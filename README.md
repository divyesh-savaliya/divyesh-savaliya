### ❤️ What I Geek Out On

**Building Bridges (Between Platforms)**  
I thrive on making apps feel right at home anywhere they land:  
→ 🍎📱 **React Native** for iOS/Android (with that native polish)  
→ 🦄 **Flutter** when we need to move fast across platforms  
→ 🌐 **Ionic** hybrids that surprise people with their smoothness  

**Web Wizardry**  
Crafting digital spaces that feel alive:  
→ ⚛️ **React/Next.js** for buttery-smooth PWAs  
→ 🚀 **Node.js** backends that handle traffic spikes like champs  
→ 🔥 **Firebase/Supabase** for real-time magic (chatty apps are my jam!)  

**Database Dance**  
Because good data relationships matter:  
→ 🗃️ **MySQL** for structured affairs  
→ 📊 **MongoDB** for flexible friendships  
→ Sometimes I play matchmaker between them  

## 🚀 Projects That Made Me Smile (and Sometimes Pull My Hair Out)

**1. The Paperless Parking Revolution**  
*"Wait, you still use paper tickets?"*  
Built a valet system handling **10k+ digital tickets daily** - watched parking attendants trade clipboards for tablets.  
→ **My favorite hack**: Real-time garage maps that reduced retrieval time by 40%  
→ **Tech stack**: Ionic + Firebase (proved hybrids can handle enterprise scale!)  

**2. Parenting SuperApp**  
Helped 500+ families turn "I'm not a math person" into "Look Mom, I did it!"  
Created a village:  
📚 Hire tutors  
🎯 Track skill progress  
👪 Share "Proud Parent" moments  
→ **Heartwarming moment**: A dyslexic teen's "I can read now!" video review  
→ **Built with**: React Native (because parenting happens on-the-go)  

**3. Social Media MVP That Almost Broke My Phone**  
Learned the hard way why Instagram's team is huge! Built a photo-sharing app where:  
📸 Filters worked *most* of the time  
💬 Real-time comments sometimes arrived yesterday 😅  
→ **Proud breakthrough**: Crushed infinite scroll performance with Supabase magic  
→ **Tech**: React Native + Supabase (because server costs scare me too)  

**4. Real Estate Rocket Fuel**  
Transformed a local broker's PDF portfolio into a NextJS showcase that:  
🏡 Sold $2M+ properties during pandemic  
📈 Cut page load time from "coffee-break" to "blink-and-miss"  
→ **Client's favorite feature**: The "Virtual Staging" AI tool I accidentally created during late-night hacking  

**5. Lead Whisperer Platform**  
Built a AI copilot for realtors that:  
🤖 Predicts hot leads (with 85% accuracy!)  
📅 Auto-schedules showings  
📱 Syncs across desktop & mobile  
→ **Secret sauce**: The "I'm ignoring you" detection algorithm (we've all been there)  
→ **Stack**: NextJS + Supabase + React Native (because brokers live on phones)  

### 🛠️ My Toolbox Philosophy

I believe in:  
→ **Code that explains itself** (your future self will thank you)  
→ **Testing with real people**, not just test cases  
→ **Documentation you'd actually want to read**  
→ **Security that's baked in**, not sprinkled on top  

## 🌟 Let's Create Something Extraordinary

Whether you're:  
→ A founder with a napkin sketch idea  
→ A team needing an extra pair of coding hands  
→ Someone who just wants to geek out about tech  

Let's make technology that feels good to use. I promise:  
- No jargon-filled meetings  
- Regular reality checks (I'll be the first to say "That API might cost $$$")  
- Occasional terrible puns
